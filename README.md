Hey there! I'm Trent.  I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative problem solving and well-crafted solutions.

I'm midwest-raised, Indiana-educated (go Hoosiers!) and currently based in Chicago.  When there's not a foot of snow on the ground and I'm not behind a screen, I spend most of my time outside running, biking and swimming in the lake.  Otherwise find me reading any sci-fi/fantasy books I can get my hands on.
