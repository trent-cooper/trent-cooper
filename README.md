Hey there! I'm Trent.  I'm a software engineer with a passion for creative problem solving and well-crafted solutions.

I recently built [Tailslide](https://tailslide-io.github.io), an open-source feature flag framework with automated failure protection, designed for easier code deployment and feature release. Check out those repos below if you want a closer look, or read this [case study](https://tailslide-io.github.io) for all the fun details.

I'm midwest-raised, Indiana-educated (go Hoosiers!), and currently based in Chicago.  When there's not a foot of snow on the ground and I'm not behind a screen, I spend most of my time outside running, biking and swimming in the lake.  Otherwise find me reading any sci-fi/fantasy books I can get my hands on.

I'm in search of new opportunities - [please reach out!](https://trent-cooper.github.io)
